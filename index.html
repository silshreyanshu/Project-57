        <p>My hobby is reading books because it makes us knowledgeable.If we read stories, it can improve our vocabulary skills.Reading books makes our mind fresh and clear.If we read books two times a day, it can improve our knowledge.Reading newspapers also gives us knowledge, as it gives information about the whole world, the countries, the states etc.Therfore I like to read books.</p>
